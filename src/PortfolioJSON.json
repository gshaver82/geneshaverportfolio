    "ProjectDescription": "This React web app will allow players of the game phasmaphobia to quickly filter out what ghost type they are dealing with. click once to confirm an evidence, and click again to exclude it. the program will automatically let you know which pieces of evidence are still relevant. for example, if freezing and EMF5 are confirmed checking spirit box and ghost writing is not needed. the only 2 ghosts left at this point both do not have spirit box and ghost writing.so, fingerprints and orbs will be noted with 'check this!' click the details button to expand on the info for each ghost if desired. playtested several times with great success!"

Technologies used: React, mongo, Oauth through firebase, firestorage, react webcam, animations, and styled components. "

From the screenshot you can see that i had the weather API and the satelite API working together to show you what sats were overhead, what direction to look and what the weather conditions were at the time. the Link not found at the bottom was for a paid API that linked the NORAD ID to the wiki for the satelite."
